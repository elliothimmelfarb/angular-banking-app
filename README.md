# Angular Pretend Money Tracker
- This is a refactored, early project of mine

- Choose an amount of money to start out with, the add debit or credit transactions and watch your pretend money fluctuate.

- If the date of the transaction has not yet passed, the transaction will be shown as a *future transaction* which will not effect your balance. After the date passes, the changes to your pretend account will occur.

- This app is persistent. Your data is stored in local storage.

- This app can also be used as a real money tracker.

### Have fun with your pretend money! You can buy whatever you always wanted.
